                This tool was developed by the <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/scps" target="window">School of Chemical and Physical Sciences</a> (SCPS)  to facilitate degree planning for Physics students. It provides a
                graphical interface for a typical BSc structure (i.e.
                over 3 years, 2 trimesters each year). Courses pre-requisites can be visualised and major requirements
                for many science major can be checked.
                Examples of full programmes (such as double majors) including Physics can be visualised easily.

            <p> <b>This not an official source of information for courses. Users should always refer to the <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/">VUW website</a>

            <p>Some important things to note:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li> This tool has not been designed as a modern multiplatform/responsive layout. Its probably works
                    only on modern browsers (Firefox and Chrome),
                    and only on devices with sufficiently large screens. There is likely to be a few layout hiccups here
                    and there. The focus is on functionality, not aesthetics.
                </li>
                <li> The list of courses is based on courses currently offered in 2025 during T1 or T2 (no T3 courses) and
                    recent changes may not be included. Some courses running over multiple trimesters or over short blocks (field trips) may not be shown correctly.
					Some courses may be missing...
                </li>
                <li> Courses from the faculty of Law are not included (there are too many courses with the same label
                    for the current layout).</li>
                <li>Major requirements are only available for a few Science majors. Many of them have not been tested
                    carefully, so always double check with the official information on the VUW website.
                </li>
